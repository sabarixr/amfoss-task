# Hello world!


This felt easy and hard at the same time. lerned someparts of new programming language, in which some felt easy and some felt really hard to understand. The task was really challenging as understanding new language took some time.
it was my fist time codeing on ruby, go, haskell, rust. Ruby felt easy than the rest. P.S. Google helped me a lot in this task maybe the only task i hadto use google a lot.
