# Geo-quest

this was one of the HArdest task i ever did. Cp was time consuming but this was more time consumming than that. Ther given documentation was only help till understanding the basics. To understand more there was a git hub reference which wasn't given in the documentation but yeah it contained many axplanation on how to do it. I am writing it as complete . but there is aminor mistake only the duration the times is over so i cant figure it out the duration is printed corectly on the console but not on the widget container. theres also minor error on the elevated button as i havent linked it to reset the time and distance but yeah it was a good task to get indroduced to a new field and it was fantastic experience asd it was my first time bulding a app. It took me the most time and even took my time to complete Cp and figure out whats wrong with my rust cargo installation. overall a good task i  learned a lot and enjoyed the same. With this i am concluding my am-fosds task. Hope i did well. Thank YOU!!
