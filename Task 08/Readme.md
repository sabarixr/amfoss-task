   While doing this task google was my best friend. I only had experience codeing basic python so this was new field to work with it took various trial and error to get to the final step. The part of creating background was kinda hard it took some time well i used an online json file sorter named JSON crack it helped me underastand the json file better.The task was not on the easy side of things as it was completly new topic. Well with the help of google i was able to figure out a lot and make it work after some time. It was one of the task that took me a while to complete.
