This was a new experience to me the task had a relativily easy concept and was very beginner friendly explained many concept which made the task easier than it look.
The concept of Harry Potter riddles made it super enjoyable task to work with, it even gave me hope that i can do this. It indroduced me to a lot of new commands i never known and i learned everything that was specified in the task. Overall provided a friendly and efficent way to learn about linux commands. loved working with it.
